<h1>Static Comp Challenge 2</h1>

<h3>Brief overview of the project</h3>
<p>Static Comp 2 is one in a series of challenges to practice HTML and CSS as well as design layout. The exercise was to reacreate a static comp with growing complexity from previous projects. While we had free reign with the content, images, icons, and color palette our mission was to remain true to the layout of the comp given to us. </p>

<h3>Personal insight</h3>
This project stretched my abilities in new ways (grid, most complex design, svg, etc.) and it was great to see what I could do with different code. I struggled with some of the formatting (IE SVG and getting the button to line up below it), getting items to line up properly and neatly, and also refactoring so my html and css didn't have excess, nonsensical code.
